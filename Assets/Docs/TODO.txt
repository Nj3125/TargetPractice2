- Move all menu related functions into Scripts/Utils/MenuFunctions (with XML documentation!)
- Add game title to Main Menu.
- (Fix?) bug where gun does not fire accurately because of quick movement.

- Bug: With new pixelation camera X & Y seem to be getting misaligned.
    - Mouse pos is fine, the crosshair shows up where the mouse is.
    - It is the gun that is not aiming correctly, I.E its pos is somehow mutated by the introduction of the camera.
    - (FIXED)

- Render the cursor through the render texture and not the GUI
